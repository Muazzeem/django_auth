### Usage

This code provides the following views and functionalities:
#### User Registration

To allow users to register, you can use the CustomUserCreateView. By default, it uses the CustomUserCreationForm from the forms.py file in this app. Users will be redirected to the login page ('login') upon successful registration.
#### User Login

User login functionality is provided through the LoginView class, which is already integrated into Django. Users will be redirected to the home page ('home') upon successful login.
#### User Logout

To allow users to log out, you can use the LogoutView class, also provided by Django. After logging out, users will be redirected to the login page ('login').
User Profile Viewing

The UserDetailView class allows users to view their own profile. It uses the CustomUser model and retrieves the currently logged-in user. You can customize the template used to display the user's profile by modifying the template_name attribute.
